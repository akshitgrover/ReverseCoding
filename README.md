# Reverse Coding
It is dual round mind-puzzling competition where math is intertwined with coding. The event makes one to have a reverse approach while solving any problem. The participants will be provided executable files that they can run and fetch the input-output test cases and hence come up with a code that would lead to those test cases. In short, a four step procedure, execute, fetch, decode and code. The first round is an online round that starts on 18th of October at 11AM and ends at 11PM same day. The second round is scheduled to be on 20th October at 11 AM which will be conducted offline. Reverse Coding is all about math, logic and fun! To be a part of it, register and form your team.
